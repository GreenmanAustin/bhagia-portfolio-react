# My Portfolio

In this project, I developed a portfolio of my current projects.  I first created the structure of this site by creating an html file with the basic elements and content.  After that, I added CSS to give the site its current style.  I also added flexbox styling to make the website responsive to different viewport sizes.  

## Deployment

My portfolio website has been deloyed and can be accessed here: https://greenmanaustin.github.io/bhagia-portfolio/

Here are three screenshots of the live website which have been roughly stitched together to give an approximation of how the website appears:

## Skills Learned

The process of creating this website really challenged my understanding of CSS.  This was the first time I had to apply my understanding of CSS without the aid of the class guidance and helped me reinforce certain skills and made me aware of all the things I do not truly understand.
